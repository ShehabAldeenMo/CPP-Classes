/*
Key Points:
1. Asynchronous vs. Synchronous:
With std::launch::async, the task runs in parallel.
With std::launch::deferred, the task executes only when the result is explicitly requested.

2. Control Over Task Execution:
You can specify the launch policy to optimize resource utilization and execution behavior.

3. Thread Safety and Synchronization:
std::async ensures that results are safely retrieved using the associated std::future object.

4. Automatic Thread Management:
With std::async, you donâ€™t need to explicitly manage threads, simplifying concurrent programming.
