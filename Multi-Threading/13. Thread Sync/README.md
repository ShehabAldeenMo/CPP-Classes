## Thread or Process Synchronization in C++

Thread or process synchronization is crucial for ensuring that multiple threads or processes access shared resources safely.

---

### What is Synchronization?

- Synchronization ensures that only one thread or process accesses a **critical section** at any given time.
- **Critical Section**: A portion of the code (one or more statements) that must not be executed by multiple threads or processes simultaneously.

### Key Points to Remember:

1. **Purpose of Synchronization:**
   - To manage access to shared resources.
   - To prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.

2. **Critical Section:**
   - A critical section can involve variables, memory locations, or resources that multiple threads/processes must access sequentially.
   - Only one thread/process can execute the critical section at a time.
